I'm a full-stack developer picking up security.
Currently looking for ways to bring my skills to automate security monitoring and compliance, and especially keen to create or improve open source software.
I develop in TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, React, Golang, C, SQL, and C#.
Working on my CISSP.
